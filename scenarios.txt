- Customer has an address

domain/collection
- Customer has many addresses
    - Each address has a type (ENUM)

// DOMAIN SCENARIOS
- Simple
   - Collections
   - Enum

- Complex
    - Object Values
    - Nested with Collections
    - Queryable field inside JSON
    - Query an InsideValueObject that's in a collection of the OuterValueObject

// TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
- How do I prevent accidental changes in my value objects that break persistence?
 - Postgres schema validation extension
- Can I migrate my stored json data into a newer json?
    - We can add a version field using a custom serializer, but, is it worth?
- Backwards compatibility
    - Change Java object name and keep the old name in the JSON @JsonProperty
    - ^ The reverse of the point above
    - Ignore properties
    - Ignore null objects
    - Old enum value in JSON non-existing on Java
    - Old object in case of nested objects
    - Custom serialize/deserialize
